## Overview

JSON is cool and all, but humans struggle with understanding it. Letâ€™s admit our human failings by creating a web frontend with React to view this data in a more user-friendly way. ðŸ¤–

## Resources

- [The AWS Java SDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/welcome.html)
- [Configure S3 for Static Sites](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/user-guide/static-website-hosting.html)

## Setup

Create a new repo `taskmaster-frontend` to hold your React app. Use `create-react-app` to generate a React app there.

For any necessary backend changes, continue working in your `taskmaster` repo, deployed via Elastic Beanstalk.

## Feature Tasks

- A user should be able to visit the homepage of your React app and see the list of all tasks available in the database.
- React should be well-factored into at least 2 components.
- The homepage should have reasonable styling and layout. (Nothing too fancy, but it shouldnâ€™t make the user cringe.)
